All you need to do to start is to run mineways.exe. Stuck? Errors? See http://mineways.com/downloads.html

This is the minimum, quick download version of Mineways, just the executable and this file. It's enough to get you going. The full version includes the 32-bit version, pre-built resource packs and tools to build your own, the documentation, scripts, and more.

Much of the original interface and file read code is from Minutor, http://seancode.com/minutor/ - all hail Sean Kasun!

// startup.mwscript - A sample startup script for Mineways, called by mineways.bat in the directory above.
// Does nothing by default, until you edit it. See comments below.
//
// version 1.00
//
// Use it by running from the command line or batch file:
//     mineways.exe startup.script
//
// Read more at http://mineways.com/scripting.html


// If you want to load a particular world on startup, choose the directory you want in your %appdata%\.minecraft\saves
// or if you store your world elsewhere, give the whole path.
// Examples:
//     Minecraft world: Super Castle
//     Minecraft world: c:\my world saves\cool build
//
// uncomment this line and fill it in:

//Minecraft world: *put your world's folder name here*


// It's convenient to jump to the player's location, since this is where you'll tend to have been making a model.
// Uncomment this line to enable (you'll also need to load a world first):

//Jump to Player

// And this setting is recommended if you are using Omniverse and a high-resolution texture set such as JG-RTX, so don't need the blocky look:
//Custom material: NO
